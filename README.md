# Lottery

This defines a Solidity contract to manage a lottery and also conducts tests in Mocha to check that all the functionality is taking place in a safe manner.
I implemented this project on the Rinkeby Test Network.

There are two kinds of people in this app:
Manager (who creates the contract),
Players.

If you want to check it out, go to the directory where you want to clone it and then:

`git clone https://github.com/rja907/Forecasty.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Then, go to your web browser and check out localhost:8080.
Let me know what you thought about it!
