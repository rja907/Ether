# Lottery

This defines a Solidity contract to manage a lottery and also conducts tests in Mocha to check that all the functionality is taking place in a safe manner.
I implemented this project on the Rinkeby Test Network.

There are two kinds of people in this app:
Manager (who creates the contract),
Players.

Let me know what you thought about it!
